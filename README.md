## Request for AI proposals

Request for AI (RFAI) Proposals describes requests for AI services that you would like to see built on the SingularityNet Platform.
A browsable version of all current and draft EIPs can be found on the official RFAI portal.

## Creating a request

* Create your request on the [RFAI portal]() and back it with the desired AGI tokens

Requests should be detailed enough to allow discussion and development. We would also like to have an objective and measurable acceptance criteria (get accuracy above X% of this data, etc). 

## Evaluation of request

Each request created via the [RFAI portal]() will be reviewed by the foundation. The approved requests will show up on the portal for others to view and back as well.
In general we look for 
* Clear problem description
* Relevant problem which if solved will help the community
* Quantitative evaluation criteria

## Submission Overview

Submissions for a request need to be published on the SingularityNet platform to be considered. 
Please refer to this [tutorial](https://dev.singularitynet.io/tutorials/publish/) for instructions on publishing services on the platform.

## Submission Process

* Submit your service on the [RFAI portal]()
* Sign your request using the same address used to publish the service. This is an important step to ensure that you are the owner of the service.

## Submission Evaluation

All submissions are evaluated by the SingularityNet foundation to ensure that the acceptance criteria as specified in the request is met and the problem is solved for.
